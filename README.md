# Getting-And-Cleaning-Data-Project


## Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Steps to work on this course project

1. Download the data source and extract it.
2. Copy the folder into your working directory
3. Download the ```run_analysis.R``` file and put it in your working directory
4. Run the ```run_analysis.R``` script
5. You now have a table named ```tidyData``` and another named ```summarizedTidyData```. The first one is the result of the four taks abve and the second is the result of the fifth task.

*Be careful : the script and the extracted data source must be in the same folder !*
